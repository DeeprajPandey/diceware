# Diceware passphrase generator.
# More info: https://www.eff.org/dice
# Note: This uses secrets, has protection against shell injection attacks,
# and I have tried to keep things as secure as possible however the best way to
# generate diceware passphrases is by hand as specified on the page above.
#
# Uses pyperclip for adding the password to the clipboard which
# depends on xclip on linux (https://pypi.org/project/pyperclip/).
#
# ----
# Security Note from pyperclip's source code
# (https://github.com/asweigart/pyperclip/blob/master/src/pyperclip/__init__.py)
# This module (pyperclip) runs programs with these names:
#     - which
#     - where
#     - pbcopy
#     - pbpaste
#     - xclip
#     - xsel
#     - wl-copy/wl-paste
#     - klipper
#     - qdbus
# A malicious user could rename or add programs with these names, tricking
# Pyperclip into running them with whatever permissions the Python process has.
